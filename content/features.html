                <h3>Offer personalised timetables</h3>

                <p>MyTimetable allows users to fully personalise their timetable. Depending on the exact wishes of the institution, students and staff can add
                    and remove timetables, for example for courses, study programmes or staff members. They can also select the student sets they are in, even
                    further personalising their timetable.</p>

                <p>Timetables can be added automatically using the integrations we offer. It is, for example, possible to use course enrolments from your
                    student information system as an additional source of information.</p>

                <p>
                    Students and staff will be familiar with and appreciate the many graphical views MyTimetable offers. Timetables can be shown per day, week,
                    or month, or using a list view for date ranges such as semesters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Colours are used to visualise different activity types. Overlap between activities can be highlighted, so students can use MyTimetable to
                    compile a clash-free timetable before enrolling for courses.

                <p>
                    Support staff can assist students and teachers by quickly looking up timetables. Room and building timetables can be viewed in several formats.

                <p>
                    An availability view allows for a birds-eye view of several rooms. It can be used to locate unoccupied rooms, or to swiftly resolve practical problems.

                <h3>Synchronise with third-party calendars</h3>

                <p>
                    Personalised timetables can be published to Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Exchange or Google Calendar using push synchronisation,
                    providing up-to-date calendars for staff and students. Staff timetables become part of their calendar, resulting in complete and correct
                    availability information when making appointments with co-workers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A pull-based synchronisation using iCalendar feeds is available for calendar applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple
                    Calendar, and various smartphone calendar applications.

                <p>Timetables can be downloaded in multiple formats, such as printable PDFs, making it easy to print your timetable while retaining the great layout of MyTimetable.</p>

                <p>Other formats, such as CSV and iCalendar files are also supported.</p>

                <h3>Open API</h3>

                <p>A fully RESTful API is available to reuse timetabling data and user profile data in portals, apps, and other applications. Data is returned in JSON or
                    XML formats. The API is secured using the OAuth 2 protocol, putting the end-users in control of their data.</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>

                <p>Timetabling data can be fully secured using a role-based access model. For example, staff or draft timetables can be hidden from
                    students when necessary, or students can be locked down to their personal timetable.</p>
