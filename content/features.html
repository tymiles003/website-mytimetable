                <h3>Fully personalised timetables</h3>

                <p>
                    MyTimetable allows students to personalise their timetable, for example by adding and removing course timetables and study programme
                    timetables. Students can also pick their student sets, even further personalising their timetable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Timetables can also be shown automatically using existing integrations, for example by using course enrolments from your student information
                    system or Blackboard as an additional source of information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Already offering personalised timetables straight from your timetabling process? It is also possible to disable personalisation in
                    MyTimetable, or limit usage to teachers and staff.

                <p>
                    Students and staff will be familiar with and appreciate the many graphical views MyTimetable offers. Timetables can be shown per day, week,
                    or month, or using a list view for date ranges such as semesters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Colours are used to visualise different activity types. Overlap between activities can be highlighted, so students can use MyTimetable to
                    compile a clash-free timetable before enrolling for courses.

                <p>
                    Personalised timetables can be published to Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Exchange or Google Calendar using push synchronisation,
                    providing up-to-date calendars for staff and students. Timetables become part of staff calendars, resulting in complete and correct
                    availability information when making appointments with co-workers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A pull-based synchronisation using iCalendar feeds is available for calendar applications such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple
                    Calendar, and various smartphone calendar applications.

                <p>
                    Support staff can assist students and teachers by quickly looking up timetables. Room and building timetables can be shown in several
                    convenient views.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The availability view allows for a birds-eye view on several rooms or a complete building. It can be used to swiftly resolve practical
                    problems, or to locate unoccupied rooms for ad-hoc meetings.

                <p>
                    Several strategies to determine draft activities are available out-of-the-box. Use tagging to mark draft activities, or consider all activities
                    as draft until the start of a semester. You can publish draft activities to staff only, allowing them to give feedback on their timetable.

                <p>Timetables can be downloaded in multiple formats, such as printable PDFs, making it easy to print your timetable while retaining the great
                    layout of MyTimetable.</p>

                <p>Other formats, such as CSV and iCalendar files are also supported.</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>

                <p>Timetabling data can be fully secured using a role-based access model. For example, staff or draft timetables can be hidden from
                    students when necessary, or students can be locked down to view only their personal timetable.</p>
