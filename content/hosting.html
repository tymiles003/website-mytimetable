                <h3>Managed hosting</h3>

                <p>Eveoh offers professional managed hosting for MyTimetable in a European data center. Some IT staff involvement is required during set up of MyTimetable, for example to connect to your timetabling software, and to set up authentication. After set up, managed hosting requires very little involvement of your IT department.</p>

                <p>Maintenance is fully managed by Eveoh. Updates of MyTimetable are carried out on a per-customer basis, and after consultation of the customer.</p>

                <p>Managed hosting comes with 24/7 monitoring and 24/7 pro-active support for high priority incidents. A 99.5% availability is guaranteed, as well as high performance of the application.</p>

                <h3>On-premises hosting</h3>

                <p>With on-premises hosting, the customer is responsible for hosting MyTimetable. Additional infrastructure is required to host MyTimetable, resulting in a higher total cost of ownership.</p>

                <p>IT staff involvement is required for setting up MyTimetable, as well as maintenance of the infrastructure and updates of MyTimetable. Eveoh assists the customer with incidents and updates for specific system software required for MyTimetable.</p>

                <p>Support is limited to office hours. The customer is responsible for monitoring, availability and performance.</p>
