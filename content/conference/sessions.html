                <p>
                    The one-day conference programme will have multiple tracks focused on different disciplines.
                    Next to plenary and track sessions, there will be plenty of networking opportunities, and possibilities to exchange knowledge and ideas with other attendees.
                    An informal dinner will be organised for all attendees interested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Based on our Dutch User Conference, we have already prepared a basic programme containing the sessions mentioned below.
                    Please note that more sessions and information will be added over the next weeks, so be sure to check back regularly for updates.
                </p>

                <h3>Call for sessions</h3>

                <p>
                    Since the User Conference is aimed at the MyTimetable users, we invite you to send proposals for presentations, workshops, breakout sessions, and discussions to complete the programme.
                    These can be sessions you want to present or chair yourself, or sessions you would like Eveoh to prepare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our current sessions are mostly aimed at functional and technical application managers.
                    We would be very happy to add sessions at a strategic and business level as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please submit your proposals to Marco Krikke at <a href="mailto:marco@eveoh.nl" class="email">marco@eveoh.nl</a>.

                    In this session, less known features of MyTimetable are showcased, that might have added value for your publication of timetables.

                <p>
                    MyTimetable is able to read timetabling data from different data sources.
                    We will showcase some solutions that are currently in use with our customers, such as displaying deadlines in MyTimetable and displaying extracurricular events in the student's timetable.
                    Also, we will discuss a transition scenario to other timetabling systems, and what the consequences of this are for the students and staff members.
