                <p>
                    Our open source products are developed and maintained for multiple customers, resulting in new features developed for and issues resolved
                    for these customers. Our support agreements offers a possibility to take advantage of these changes and improvements in the application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eveoh also provides maintenance to support future versions of back-end products, like Scientia Syllabus Plus, Microsoft SharePoint or
                    Blackboard, and future browser versions. This way, the application is future proof and no problems will arise when upgrading.

                <p>
                    We recommend the software assurance package for most of the customers. With this package, an 8x5 helpdesk is available, incidents will be
                    resolved free of charge, and the customer will profit from future developments of the application.
