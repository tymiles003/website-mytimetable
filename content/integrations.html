                <h3>Integrate your timetable with your calendar</h3>

                <p>
                    MyTimetable offers direct integration with leading calendar platforms, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google Apps for Education.
                    Timetable activities become appointments in the user's main calender, allowing students and co-workers to schedule meetings based on
                    complete and correct availability information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Key advantages:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Personalised timetable becomes part of your main calendar</li>
                    <li>Up-to-date availability information for other users</li>
                    <li>Push based: MyTimetable determines the update frequency</li>
                    <li>No separate calendar that is hidden to other users, as with iCalendar subscriptions</li>

                <p>MyTimetable push synchronisation is available for the following platforms:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft Office 365 (cloud based)</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Exchange (on-premises)</li>

                <h3>Selective synchronisations</h3>

                <p>
                    Students and staff can select which timetables they want to have synchronised to their calendar. Teachers can for example add and view other
                    staff timetables in MyTimetable, but limit synchronisation to their own timetable.

                <h3>Opt-in vs Opt-out</h3>

                <p>
                    Push synchronisation is offered as an opt-in and an opt-out option. Using opt-in, users have to manually connect MyTimetable to their
                    calendar by one simple action in MyTimetable. Institutions can also by default enable the synchronisation for (a group of) users using the
                    opt-out model.

                <p>
                    Users can cancel push synchronisations from MyTimetable. Synchronised activities from their timetable can be automatically deleted again,
                    if required. It is also possible to leave the calendar appointments in place, or remove only future activities.

        <div class="row">

                <h3>iCalendar subscriptions</h3>

                <p>
                    MyTimetable supports iCalendar subscriptions out-of-the-box. Calender applications that support the iCalendar format can be linked to
                    MyTimetable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These applications will pull the user's personal iCalendar feed containing the user's timetable periodically to keep the calendar
                    up-to-date.
                </p>

                <h3>Supported clients</h3>

                <p>iCalendar subscriptions can be used with any client that supports the iCalendar format, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Microsoft Outlook</li>
                    <li>Google Calendar</li>
                    <li>Apple Calendar</li>
                    <li>Smartphone and tablet calendar apps</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Push vs pull</h3>

                <p>
                    With pull synchronisation, calendar clients such as Microsoft Outlook, retrieve the user's timetable from MyTimetable. The client decides
                    when the timetable is refreshed, MyTimetable can not determine when this happens. With some clients, the user can configure the refresh
                    rate. For many cloud based services, the cloud provider determines the refresh rate, which can result in a delay of several hours.The user's
                    timetable will show up in the client as a separate calendar, and will not be taken into account when planning meetings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With push synchronisation, MyTimetable determines when to refresh the user's timetable, for example after a change occurred in a timetable.
                    In this scenario, MyTimetable is responsible for keeping the calendar up to date. The user's timetable will be part of the main calendar of
                    the user, and therefore will be taken into account when planning meetings.

                <p>
                    MyTimetable comes with a Blackboard Learn building block that shows the user's upcoming activities, and allows the user to navigate to the

                <p>
                    Next to this, the building block contains a small REST API allowing MyTimetable to request the user's course enrolments from Blackboard
                    Learn. These enrolments are used as suggested timetables in MyTimetable.

        <p>
            Together with <a href="http://pexip.com/" target="_blank">Pexip</a> &mdash; a leading innovator in scalable, distributed videoconferencing software
            &mdash; we integrated virtual lectures straight into MyTimetable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Students can join virtual lectures from their personalised timetable just by clicking a single button, greatly improving user experiences. High
            definition virtual lectures can be joined from virtually any web browser and device without the need to even install custom software or apps.
        </p>

        <p>
            Teachers benefit from a fully automated workflow and can focus on teaching, instead of dealing with technology. Scheduled virtual lectures
            automatically start at the beginning of the lecture, using the equipment available in the lecture room. The lecturer does not need to dial in, or
            perform any manual actions.
        </p>

        <p>
            All virtual lectures can be managed from the timetabling software, requiring very little training for staff. Support for Scientia Syllabus Plus is
            provided out-of-the-box.

                Course enrolments from your student information system can be used to automate the student workflow. Student timetables will show up
                automatically in MyTimetable, without the need to perform any manual actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                By using enrolment data, students can be offered a fully personalised timetable, without the need for personal timetables as an output of your
                timetabling process. Student timetables can also be locked-down, limiting access to their personal timetable only.
