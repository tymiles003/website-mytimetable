                <h3>Integrate your timetable with your calendar</h3>

                <p>
                    MyTimetable offers direct integration with leading calendar platforms, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google Apps for Education.
                    Timetable activities become appointments in the user's main calender, allowing students and co-workers to schedule meetings based on
                    complete and correct availability information.
                </p>

                <h4>Key advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personalised timetable becomes part of your main calendar</li>
                    <li>Up-to-date availability information for other users</li>
                    <li>Push based: MyTimetable determines the update frequency</li>
                    <li>No separate calendar that is hidden to other users, as with iCalendar subscriptions</li>

                <p>
                    Students and staff can select which timetables they want to have synchronised to their calendar. Lecturers can for example add and view
                    other lecturer's timetables in MyTimetable, but limit synchronisation to their own timetable.

                <p>
                    Push synchronisation is offered as an opt-in and an opt-out option. Using opt-in, users have to manually connect MyTimetable to their
                    calendar by one simple action in MyTimetable. Institutions can also by default enable the synchronisation for (a group of) users using the
                    opt-out model.

                <p>
                    Users can cancel push synchronisations from MyTimetable. Synchronised activities from their timetable can be automatically removed again,
                    if required. It is also possible to leave the calendar appointments in place, or remove only future activities.

                <p>
                    MyTimetable supports iCalendar subscriptions out of the box. Calender applications that support the iCalendar format can be linked to
                    MyTimetable. iCalendar subscriptions can be used with any client that supports the iCalendar format.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These applications will pull the user's personal iCalendar feed containing the user's timetable periodically to keep the calendar
                    up-to-date.

                <p>
                    MyTimetable comes with a Blackboard Learn building block that shows the user's upcoming activities, and allows the user to navigate to the
                    full MyTimetable interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next to this, the building block contains a small REST API allowing MyTimetable to request the user's course enrolments from Blackboard
                    Learn. These enrolments are used as suggested timetables in MyTimetable.

                    Because of the modular architecture of MyTimetable, support for new data sources or timetabling software can be added easily and affordable.

                    Together with <a href="http://pexip.com/" target="_blank">Pexip</a> &mdash; a leading innovator in scalable, distributed videoconferencing software
                    &mdash; we integrated virtual lectures straight into MyTimetable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Students can join virtual lectures from their personalised timetable just by clicking a single button, greatly improving user experiences. High
                    definition virtual lectures can be joined from virtually any web browser and device without the need to even install custom software or apps.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lecturers benefit from a fully automated workflow and can focus on teaching, instead of dealing with technology. Scheduled virtual lectures
                    automatically start at the beginning of the lecture, using the equipment available in the lecture room. The lecturer does not need to dial in, or
                    perform any manual actions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All virtual lectures can be managed from the timetabling software, requiring very little training for staff. Support for Scientia Syllabus Plus is
                    provided out of the box.

            <p>
                By using enrolment data, students can be offered a fully personalised timetable, without the need for personal timetables as an output of your
                timetabling process. Student timetables can also be locked-down, limiting access to their personal timetable only.
